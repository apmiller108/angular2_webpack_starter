# Angular 2 Webpack Starter

This boilerplate follows the [angular.io webpack
introduction](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html) with some minor
changes, as well as the inclusion of sass loading.

# What's Included:

* Typescript
* An opinionated Tslint configuration
* Karma for running tests
* Jasmine testing framework
* Webpack configurations for test, development and production environments
* Flexbox Grid

# Start the development server

`npm start`

# Run tests

`npm test` 

NOTE: singleRun is set to false and autowatch is true. This means that tests
will run automatically when file changes are detected.

# Build the project

`npm run build` 

This will create a `/dist` folder in which compiled project files will be
placed.
